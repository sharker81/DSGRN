# FPQuery2
# Usage:
#
#  This command takes one of five keywords as its first argument, and depending on the keyword possibly extra arguments
#  Details follow
#
#   First Usage:
#
#   python ./FPQuery2.py database_filename SingleFP JSON-STRING-SPECIFYING-ALLOWED-FP-LOCATIONS
#
#   Return list of parameters for which there exists an FP node in the specified region
#
#   Example:
#     python ./FPQuery2.py 5D_2016_02_08_cancer_withRP_essential_VA.db SingleFP '{"EE1":[2,4],"RP":[0,4]}' > query.txt
#
#    This means variable EE1 can be in bin 2, 3, or 4, while variable RP can be in bins 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. All
#    other variables can be in any bin
#
#   Second Usage:
# 
#   python ./FPQuery2.py database_filename DoubleFP JSON1 JSON2
#   
#   Return list of parameters for which there exists an FP node in the region indicated by JSON1
#   and another (distinct from the first) FP node in the region indicated by JSON2
#   The JSON strings are in the same formet as SingleFP
#
#   Example:
#     python ./FPQuery2.py 5D_2016_02_08_cancer_withRP_essential_VA.db DoubleFP '{"EE1":[2,4],"RP":[0,4]}' '{"EE1":[2,4],"RP":[0,1]}'
#
#   Other usages:
#   python ./FPQuery2.py database_filename UniqueStable
#    returns list of parameters with a unique minimal Morse node
#
#   python ./FPQuery2.py database_filename Bistable
#     returns list of parameters with precisely two minimal Morse nodes
#
#   python ./FPQuery2.py database_filename Multistable
#     returns list of parameters with two or more minimal Morse nodes
#   
#  Note: In all cases, the parameters are returned in sorted order. In order to combine queries,
#        one solution is to use the "comm" command in the Unix bash shell, i.e.
#        comm -12 query1.txt query2.txt > intersectedquery.txt
